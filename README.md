# Video Engineering Journey üé•

## Mission
Building next-generation video compression solutions for global internet reality - optimizing for 2G/3G connections, not just fiber.

## üî• Latest Breakthrough - Day 1
**69% compression achieved** while maintaining 640x360 quality - perfect for Nigeria's 2G/3G networks!

| Original | Compressed | Reduction |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| 21.1MB   | 6.5MB      | **69%**   |

## Current Status
- **Week**: 1, Day 1
- **Focus**: FFmpeg Compression Optimization  
- **Latest Achievement**: Systematic compression testing with proven 69% reduction

## Journey Overview
3-month intensive learning path to become a Video Engineering Specialist:
- **Month 1**: Foundations + Video Compression Mastery ‚Üê *Currently here*
- **Month 2**: Streaming Protocols + Advanced Compression
- **Month 3**: Production Deployment + Job Preparation

## üöÄ Active Projects
- **[FFmpeg Compression Optimizer](./projects/month-1/ffmpeg-experiments/)** - Optimized compression for poor connections
- **Compression Test Suite** - Automated testing scripts for systematic optimization

## Key Results So Far
### Video Compression Breakthrough
- **69% file size reduction** while maintaining watchable quality
- **Optimized for 2G networks** - 640x360 resolution at 200kbps
- **CPU-safe processing** - temperature controlled compression
- **Systematic methodology** - reproducible test framework

## Technical Stack Learning
- **FFmpeg** - Advanced compression techniques
- **H.264 codec** - Parameter optimization  
- **Linux systems** - Performance monitoring and optimization
- **C programming** - Building toward custom solutions

## Daily Progress
See [daily logs](./docs/daily-logs/) for detailed progress tracking.

## The Problem We're Solving
5+ billion people globally struggle with poor internet connections, but current video compression technology is built for Silicon Valley speeds, not reality. We're changing that.
**Target**: Build compression solutions that work smoothly on 2G/3G networks globally.
